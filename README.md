## Getting Started
 I am making a word guessing game based on Object Oriented JavaScript. This game is similar to hangman. 
 
It will allow you to have 5 lives that will be removed one by one as you guess the phrase by letter. As a letter on the keyboard is clicked it will disable that key and show you that it has been selected and weather it is a letter in the phrase or is incorrect. 
 
The phrase is randomly generated by a random number generator that should generate a new number and displays the phrase based on index for each game. This project currently contains only 5 phrases but is scalable in the way that the number generator will generate a number based on the number of phrases there are in the project. 
 
 ### Installation or Dependencies
 
 I added JQuery to my project index.html file to make it easier to traverse the DOM
