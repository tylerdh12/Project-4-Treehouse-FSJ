# TeamTreehouse-OOP_Game_Show_App-Unit_4_Project

> This is my Unit 4 TreeHouse Tech Degree Project

## Getting Started
 I am making a word guessing game based on Object Oriented JavaScript. This game is similar to hangman. 
 
 It will allow you to have 5 lives that will be removed one by one as you guess the phrase by letter. As a letter on the keyboard is clicked it will disable that key and show you that it has been selected and weather it is a letter in the phrase or is incorrect. 
 
 The phrase is randomly generated by a random number generator that should generate a new number and displays the phrase based on index for each game. This project currently contains only 5 phrases but is scalable in the way that the number generator will generate a number based on the number of phrases there are in the project.
